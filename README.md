# $tock News ("Project1_Group10")

## Description

This repository ("Project1_Group10") is where we (Sam Gates, Nelson Johns, Thang Nguyen, and Nathan Taylor) develop the [$tock News](https://ntjohns1.github.io/Project1_Group10/) web application. 

[$tock News](https://ntjohns1.github.io/Project1_Group10/) provides the user with a simplistic way to check for current stock market prices and catalog recent news articles from various outlets relating to that stock. This lightweight application offers the user a quick and realtime resource/tool for market research or analysis. We aim to offer a straight forward and responsive interface across different browsers and devices for ease of accessibility. 

Our web application incorporates third party APIs for the primary functions. We also included a history sidebar for the user to keep track of and quickly access previous stock searches. The application also includes a "Top Stocks" table that updates in realtime.
